        I&apos;ve always heard people say, &apos;Content is King.&apos; 
        But now, with so much content everywhere, it&apos;s no wonder that AI has found its way into the world of creativity.
      </FirstP>
      <p>
        Having a blog created by AI isn&apos;t just something from a sci-fi movie anymore. 
        From predicting trends to chatbots that talk like humans, <Link className="underline text-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-gauges-how-people-perceive-ai-created-content">AI-Generated content</Link> is changing how we connect with our customers online. 
        This makes me wonder: Should AI-generated blogs be part of my content strategy?
      </p>
      <p>The short answer: yes. Combining creativity with technology opens up so many possibilities. 
        But with every new technology, there&apos;s a need to think carefully about how to use it and really understand the &apos;whats&apos;, &apos;whys&apos;, and &apos;hows&apos;.</p>
      <Subheader value="Human Content vs. AI Automation"/>
      <p>
        When I think about AI blogging, there&apos;s something special about the human touch that AI can&apos;t deliver. 
        That unique charm in a story about your cat keeps readers coming back for more. It feels personal, and that&apos;s 
        why people love it.
      </p>
      <p>Human-generated content is still valued for a couple of reasons:</p>    
      <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-4 px-8">
        <li>It&apos;s authentic storytelling based on personal experiences.</li>
        <li>It creates an emotional connection with the audience.</li>
        <li>It has a creative flair that AI hasn&apos;t quite mastered yet.</li>
        <li>Only humans can truly understand the impact of words on society.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But then, there&apos;s AI automation. Picture a tool where you put in a topic and get a draft back quickly. 
        This draft may contain a lot of exciting subtitles and subtopics that you might think, but at least at a 
        different speed.</p>
        <p>Despite what some people believe, AI content creation has its benefits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-4 px-8">
            <li>It moves you from the &quot;blank canvas syndrome&quot; to something your brain can start working on immediately.</li>
            <li>It can quickly produce outlines.</li>
            <li>It&apos;s excellent at optimizing for SEO.</li>
            <li>AI keeps your brand voice consistent across all content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI has been a hot topic for a while, especially regarding authenticity. 
            Some people see it as a replacement for human talent. I completely disagree with these statements. 
            At the same time, AI can be a powerful helper, offering speed, consistency, and the ability to handle a lot 
            of work. Looking at it this way, it&apos;s not about choosing between human or AI-generated content. 
            It&apos;s about how we can combine both to create efficient and impactful content.</p>
        <Subheader value="Understanding AI Blogging"/>
        <p>AI blogging is like giving a robot a pen and telling it to start writing. 
            But how does it work? First, let me briefly explain an AI-generated blog.</p>
        <p>When you use a tool like <Link className="underline text-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://go.experior.ai">Experior</Link>, for example, to produce blog articles, you need to provide some parameters for the AI to create your drafts, such as the overall subject, keywords, style of writing, and tone. 
        Based on those parameters, the AI bot uses all the textual content it has been trained on to calculate the most likely words to complete the task.
        </p>
        <p>Think of a very advanced and complex &quot;auto-complete writer&quot; tool, 
            similar to the one you have on your mobile phone but more complex and robust.</p>
        <p>But as you could have imagined, those &quot;auto-complete tools&quot; can&apos;t think or 
            know about your subject. That&apos;s not how an AI text generation tool works. 
            They calculate the probability of your prompt&apos;s next word and try to produce a reasonable 
            text based on those probabilities. And that&apos;s not even close to how humans do things.</p>        
        <p>Here&apos;s how it works step by step:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-4 px-8">
            <li><span className="font-bold">Content Briefing:</span> You briefly describe what you want to write about.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Keyword Specification:</span> You tell the AI your preferred keywords.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Quality Control:</span> You set the tone and readability to match your brand.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Content Creation:</span> The AI makes a draft based on what you&apos;ve told it.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Review & Edit:</span> You tweak, personalize, and finalize the content.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t (or at least &quot;shouldn&apos;t&quot;) just copy an AI-generated blog as is and publish it on 
        your blog. This AI-generated article will need human revision. Remember, AI tools are helpers that make 
        your life as a content creator easier. They are not replacements for human creativity.</p>
        <p>But truthfully, AI tools are getting better and better over time. Sure, AI alone won&apos;t win a 
            Pulitzer anytime soon, but it&apos;s getting impressively good.</p>
      <Subheader value="Integrating AI Content Creation into Your Strategy"/>
      <p>Using AI to create content doesn&apos;t mean letting a robot take over your blog and hoping for the best. 
            It&apos;s more about teaming up with AI to enhance what you&apos;re already doing.</p>
      <p>Adding AI-generated blogs to your content strategy is like adding a new team member without needing more office space. 
            It&apos;s about using AI wisely and finding areas where it can help.</p>
      <p>For instance, AI can handle the heavy lifting, leaving you more time for opinion pieces, heartfelt 
            stories, and creative ideas.</p>
      <p>Before diving in, check if the AI tool fits with your content strategy. Start by trying it out in 
            parts of your content where AI can help, not take over.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-4 px-8">
            <li><span className="font-bold">Assess Your Content Needs:</span> Look at your current content and see where AI could fit in. 
            Besides blogs, think about social media posts, email newsletters, and other content.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Choose the Right AI Tool:</span> Not all AI writing tools are identical. 
            Pick one that can learn your brand&apos;s voice and produce good-quality content. Take some trial time to get to 
            know and get comfortable with the software. 
            Knowing what to look for and how to use it is the first step in getting the best AI-generated blog output â€“ 
            which sounds much more like you than a generic bot. <Link className="underline text-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://go.experior.ai">Experior</Link> is an AI tool that has helped many content creators 
            write over 1000 articles in the past weeks.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Collaborate with AI for Creative Brainstorming:</span> Allow AI to be your brainstorming buddy. 
            Inject AI blogs into your ideation process to generate topics, headlines, and outlines that capture the topic. 
            You may be surprised at how efficient it can be for analyzing trends and spotting content gaps that humans 
            might miss.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Run a Pilot:</span> Start with a small test. Check the quality of AI-generated drafts 
            and see the main pieces that most require your input. That&apos;ll help you adjust the AI&apos;s output before fully 
            committing.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Blend with Human Touch:</span> AI can structure and draft content quickly, but the final touch 
            should be yours. The most crucial step is to refine the AI-generated content. Human insight is still vital, 
            even with AI&apos;s smart copying. In a nutshell, AI can bring your audience to the doorstep, but the human touch 
            invites them in to stay and engage.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Keep Content Fresh and Up-to-Date:</span> One of the most significant advantages of AI in 
            content creation is its ability to process and analyze data quickly. Use that to your advantage to maximize 
            engagement by using AI to update and refresh older posts regularly. That&apos;ll help maintain relevance and serve 
            readers who expect up-to-the-minute information.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Monitor Performance:</span> Monitor the performance of your AI-generated blogs, 
            just as you would with posts written by people. Use this information to fine-tune your strategy.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Test, Learn, and Evolve:</span> Digital content is agile, and AI content tools 
            facilitate this more than anything else. They allow you to quickly test different blog versions, analyze 
            performance, and iterate faster than traditional methods. It&apos;s a dynamic learning loop, constantly refining to 
            hit the sweet spot with your audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <Subheader value="Final Thoughts"/>
        <p>Every modern-day digital creator wonders whether to use AI. I created <Link className="underline text-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://go.experior.ai">Experior</Link> as a partner for 
            content creators, a shortcut for them to deliver more quickly. By no means was it my intention for 
            people to use our content generation tools to flood the internet with unrevised AI-generated content. 
            And we&apos;re always transparent with our customers about this.</p>
        <p>AI is not here to replace human creativity but to augment it, ensuring we can tell our stories, share 
            our knowledge, and connect with others in previously impossible ways. And there are many ways that 
            AI can help free yourself from the &quot;blank canvas syndrome&quot;. But you are the one holding the leash.</p>
        <p>Let AI be your partner and guide to expedite tasks that would take longer to deliver. Ask for 
            suggestions, ask it to paraphrase pieces of texts, rewrite stuff, and use its power at your side.</p>
        <p>At the same time, be clear about your expectations. AI content generation tools are not experts on 
            any subject. So AI-generated blogs require your validation. Use it often, but use it wisely.</p>
        <p>Here at <Link className="underline text-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://go.experior.ai">Experior</Link>, we have been working day and night to calibrate our large language models (LLMs) to 
            generate great outlines and quality blog drafts on virtually any topic. You can start by providing a 
            simple text description of your blog, or you can provide external sources, like YouTube videos or 
            website links, so our AI can use this context in the creation of your draft.</p>
